This is PeerStreamer, a P2P Media Streaming framework written in C.

Quick Start
===========

Run "make" and you will find the executable in "Streamers/streamer-grapes".

See the built-in help ("Streamers/streamer-grapes -h") for usage examples and options.


Building and running the simple version (GRAPES I/O)
====================================================

Compilation
-----------
Create executables by running:
make

Running the source
------------------
1, Start the source peer in one shell:
Streamers/streamer-grapes -f ~/video/big_bunny_orig/big_buck_bunny_480p_stereo.avi -m 3
or
ffmpeg -i ~/video/myvideo.avi -f nut -vcodec mpeg4 -b 500000 -o /dev/stdout | Streamers/streamer-grapes -f /dev/stdin -m 3

Running a peer
--------------



Building and running the complex version (chunkstream I/O)
==========================================================

The complex version contains a separate chunker and player application.

Compilation
-----------
Create executables by running:
make ml-chunkstream

Running the source
------------------
1, Start the source peer in one shell:
Streamers/streamer-ml-monl-chunkstream-static -f tcp://127.0.0.1:7777 -m 3

2, In another shell, go to the Chunker's folder
cd ChunkerPlayer/chunker_streamer

3, Verify that the streamer is set up correctly:
chunker.conf should contain:
outsideWorldUrl = "tcp://127.0.0.1:7777"

3, Start the chunker (after the source peer has been started!):
./chunker_streamer -i ~/video/big_bunny_orig/big_buck_bunny_480p_stereo.avi -a 128000 -v 500000
or
./chunker_streamer -i /dev/stdin -l -a 128000 -v 500000
